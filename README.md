=======

PIC Microcontroller XC8 projects.

This repository (will) contains libraries or pieces of code about PIC programming using XC8 compiler. This newly compiler lacks many libraries 
(Microchip haven't released official libraries yet).



My current devices:
- PIC16LF84A
- PIC18F2550
- PIC18F2585
- PIC18F45K50
NOTE: not all firmwares are written for each device, check all sub-README files.

Current projects:
- PWM receiver (converting to 3/4 states)
- PWM generator
- DMX receiver (to pilot leds) 

Old projects:
- USB Framework: currently stopped, XC8 cannot work correctly with usb beacuse it's not able to access to USB Memory (search several topics in 
microchip forum)
